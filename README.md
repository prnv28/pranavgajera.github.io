## Projects
### Neural Machine Translation using Transforme
[Publication]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762))

Implementation of a paper on Neural Machine Translation using Transformer units from scratch to translate English to
Hindi using IITB dataset.

### Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks
[Publication]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907))

Implemented Multi-Class classification on citation network data using Multi Layer graph convolution network and
achieved SOTA classification accuracy compared to other conventional methods.

### Comparative study of contextualized word representations
[Publication]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907))

Study done on word embeddings generated by BERT and GPT2’s intermediate layers on how well these embeddings
can perform on down stream tasks compared to static word embeddings.

### Attention based machine translation
[Publication]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907))

Used Encoder-Decoder based machine translation to translate human readable dates to machine readable dates using
self attention mechanism integrated with GRU.

### Financial Sentiment Analysis
[Publication]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907))

Implemented Sentiment classification on financial news data in multi-class sentiments using DAN (Deep Averaging
Networks) and BERT’s last layer CLS tokens on pre-trained word embeddings(GLoVe) and found using BERT’s it is
giving good result even on imbalance data sets.

### Principal Component Analysis and Multi-Class Support Vector Machines
[Publication]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907))

Implemented PCA to reduce the dimension of data points and using the lower dimensional data points implemented
Multi-Class SVM algorithms using 1-vs-all classifiers on the MNIST data-set.

### Clustering Image pixels and represent image to k depth color image
[Publication]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907))

K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the pixels of the image, with a given number of clusters k= 2,5,10,20,50
to represent the image with k depth color image.
